# Assura Roadmap

This is the high-level roadmap agents should use to orient work. Keep each epic
name short enough to scan quickly, then track concrete work in Trellis tasks.

## Roadmap Iterations And Epics

## Active Roadmap Iteration

No roadmap iteration is active after Iteration 01 completion.

Current owning task:
None.

Current branch:
None.

Most recent completed iteration: Policy Depth Iteration 02. Goals 09 through
13 are complete and archived, ending with Goal 13 PR #55 and archive PR #56.
Release Contract Rules first slice is complete via PR #59 and archive PR #60.
Public Surface Matrix first slice is complete via PR #61 and archive PR #62.
Cargo Manifest Semantics first slice is complete via PR #64 and archive PR
#65.
Test Relationship Rule first slice is complete via PR #68 and archive PR #69.
Module Topology Rule first slice is complete via PR #72 and archive PR #73.
Docs Lifecycle Rule first slice is complete via PR #78 and archive PR #79.
Docs Lifecycle Coverage first dogfood expansion is complete via PR #83.
Support Matrix Surface Expansion is complete via PR #88; archive/sync is
pending in the current PR.
This completion does not mark the broader Assura roadmap complete.

Direction lock, clarified on 2026-05-31: do not create or revive
`assura-codex-feedback`, do not add one CLI entrypoint per agent, and do not add
one `--format <agent>-hook` value per agent. Treat older roadmap/task wording in
that direction as superseded by `.trellis/spec/assura/codex-agent-feedback.md`.

Planned next roadmap candidate:
None selected after Support Matrix Surface Expansion completion. The next
candidate should come from fresh target-state evidence, not from reopening the
completed support-matrix expansion slice.

## Recommended Next Action

Revalidate current target-state evidence before selecting the next goal.

The next agent should use `assura-goal-validation` to compare
`.assura/config.yml`, `cargo xtask target-state`, and this roadmap before
creating a new bounded goal. Do not reopen the completed support-matrix
expansion unless a new concrete docs, manifest, package, binary, or support
status drift case is named with executable evidence. The product roadmap
remains open until a separate product decision declares it complete.

## Roadmap Rules

- Use this roadmap in every non-trivial workflow status snapshot.
- Keep epic names at 3-5 words where practical.
- Put detailed implementation work in Trellis tasks, not in this roadmap.
- If a new roadmap iteration or epic is needed, add it here and identify the
  first Trellis task that owns it.
- If an iteration or epic is active, say which task owns it and what the next
  recommended action is.
- Completing an iteration closes only that iteration; the roadmap remains open
  until a separate product decision declares the full roadmap complete.
