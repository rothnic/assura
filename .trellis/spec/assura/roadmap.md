# Assura Roadmap

This is the high-level roadmap agents should use to orient work. Keep each epic
name short enough to scan quickly, then track concrete work in Trellis tasks.

## Roadmap Iterations And Epics

| Order | Epic | Status | Active/Open Work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Trellis Workflow Foundation | Completed | PR #1 merged; task archived under `.trellis/tasks/archive/2026-06/` |
| 2 | Tooling Baseline Cleanup | Completed | PRs #2-#4 merged; tasks archived under `.trellis/tasks/archive/2026-06/` |
| 3 | Assura Self-Check Clean | Completed | PR #5 merged; current self-check remains clean |
| 4 | Documentation Source Truth | Completed | Historical workflow systems are archived or marked historical |
| 5 | Windows CI Restore | Later | fix `libgit2-sys` MSVC linker failure and restore matrix entry |
| 6 | Beyond Ls-Lint Rules | Completed | PRs #8, #11, and #12 merged; performance/parity tasks archived |
| 7 | Agent Feedback MVP | Completed | PRs #13-#16 merged; keep stable `assura check --format agent` surface |
| 8 | Agentic Adoption Iteration 01 / Phase 01 | Completed | Archived task `.trellis/tasks/archive/2026-06/06-01-roadmap-phase-01-execution` |
| 9 | Policy Depth Iteration 02 | Planned | `docs/goals/assura-roadmap-iteration-02-policy-depth-and-ecosystem.md`; goals 09-13 now define the next major chunks |

## Active Roadmap Iteration

No roadmap iteration is active after Iteration 01 completion.

Current owning task:
None.

Current branch:
None.

Most recent completed iteration: Agentic Adoption Iteration 01 / Phase 01.
Goals 01 through 08 are complete and the execution task is archived. This
completion does not mark the broader Assura roadmap complete.

Direction lock, clarified on 2026-05-31: do not create or revive
`assura-codex-feedback`, do not add one CLI entrypoint per agent, and do not add
one `--format <agent>-hook` value per agent. Treat older roadmap/task wording in
that direction as superseded by `.trellis/spec/assura/codex-agent-feedback.md`.

Planned next roadmap iteration:
`docs/goals/assura-roadmap-iteration-02-policy-depth-and-ecosystem.md`.
The planned Iteration 02 major goal sequence now lives in goals 09 through 13
under `docs/goals/`.

## Recommended Next Epic

Activate Policy Depth Iteration 02 when maintainers are ready to start the next
bounded program:
`docs/goals/assura-roadmap-iteration-02-policy-depth-and-ecosystem.md`.
Starting that iteration should create a new Trellis task and branch. The
product roadmap remains open until a separate product decision declares it
complete.

## Roadmap Rules

- Use this roadmap in every non-trivial workflow status snapshot.
- Keep epic names at 3-5 words where practical.
- Put detailed implementation work in Trellis tasks, not in this roadmap.
- If a new roadmap iteration or epic is needed, add it here and identify the
  first Trellis task that owns it.
- If an iteration or epic is active, say which task owns it and what the next
  recommended action is.
- Completing an iteration closes only that iteration; the roadmap remains open
  until a separate product decision declares the full roadmap complete.
